# Minishell
The Mini Shell project is a command line interpreter designed to replicate the essential functionalities of the Bash shell. This project offers a lightweight alternative to the full Bash shell and is a great way to gain a deeper understanding of how shells work and how commands are executed in a Unix-like environment.
